Process Injection Method for Process Hijacking

This repository contains a C++ application that demonstrates process hijacking by utilizing process injection on the Windows operating system. The application allows taking control of a specified process and executing a user-provided command within the hijacked process.

⚠️ WARNING: This code is intended for illustrative purposes of the process injection technique. Please refrain from using such operations for unlawful or malicious purposes. The unauthorized and malicious use of these techniques can lead to serious security issues and legal liabilities.

ℹ️ NOTE: This code involves potentially dangerous actions, such as creating high-privileged processes and injecting code into the memory of other processes. Therefore, it should only be used in appropriate scenarios and for development/analysis purposes. The responsibility lies solely with the user of this code.

Examine carefully and ensure it is used in compliance with all legal and ethical standards. Executing such operations may lead to unauthorized access and security breaches.
